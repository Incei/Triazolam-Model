The final alprazolam PBPK model applies metabolism by CYP3A4, modelled as two separate pathways yielding Î±-hydroxy-alprazolam and 4-hydroxy-alprazolam as metabolites, and glomerular filtration. Overall, the model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of alprazolam in healthy, non-obese adults receiving different single IV or PO dose of alprazolam in the fasted state.
